								<span class="image main"><img src="images/JPL_selfie copy.jpg"  alt="" /></span>
								<p> I'm Carlos Pareja, a first generation student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I have a passion for studying the fields of Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Data Science, and all of their cross disciplines! </p>
								<p> I'm also a second year transfer student at UC San Diego and a proud community college alumn. I started my academic career at <a href="https://pasadena.edu">Pasadena City College</a> where I was an Astrophysics major. I graduated from Pasadena City College with three Associate Degrees in Physics, Mathematics, and Natural Sciences. </p>
								<p> I come from a Mexican-Peruvian background, therefore, equality in STEM is very important to me and I try my best to advocate for, encourage, and support fellow Hispanics in STEM to be successful. On campus, I'm involved in the UC San Diego chapter of <a href="https://shpe.org">Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) </a> </p>
								<p> I was an Astrophysics major up until my first quarter at UC San Diego (Fall 2021), this is when I made the switch to the Math-Computer Science major. I first fell in love with the field of physics after reading Stephen Hawking's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">A Brief History of Time</a> my freshman year of high school. 
									I pursued physics all throughout high school and went into Pasadena City College with the intention of becoming an astrophysicist. During the summer after graduating from Pasadena City College and the summer before my first quarter at UC San Diego, I was a <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu">Lamat</a> computational astrophysics intern at the University of California,
									 Santa Cruz where I worked with Professor <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dongwook/">Dongwook Lee</a> of the Applied Mathematics department and Professor <a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=raruiz">Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</a> from the Astrophysics department. During this summer internship, I worked on implementing Gaussian Process Models for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations. </p>

								<p> Although I worked on a project that can be applied to the field of astrophysics, I fell in love with the ability to code, problem solve, create software using highly advanced mathematics and statistics. This newly discovered passion for coding for scientific applications heavily influenced me to pursue more programming classes and I realized that becoming an astrophysicist was not the only path for me. </p>
								<p> Today, I apply my passions in machine learning, physics, and programming as a whole to the field of high energy physics and machine learning as an undergraduate researcher for Duarte Lab at UC San Diego where I'm developing a Machine Learning Python package and working with unsupervised learning models for particle physics classification. I've also applied my programming and Machine Learning skills to developing software at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the upcoming galaxy-redshift survey, <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/spherex">SPHEREx</a>. </p>
								<!-- <p> I am looking to gain further experience as a Machine Learning Engineer or a Software Engineer. My experience with working customer service jobs like a cashier, food and grocery delivery driver allowed me to meet and understand people from all differnt backgrounds and this experience has led to success in my ability to work with people of all of backgrounds and has allowed to effectively communicate the science and work that I develop. Thank you for taking the time at reading a bit about me!</p>

								<h3> Investigating AirBnB Rentals and the Relationship with Different Attributes in the New York Area (October 2022 - December 2022) </h3>
								<p style="color: burlywood;">Skills: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, SciPy, Matplotlib, Patsy, Statsmodels </p>
								<p> &#x2022; Conducted research and exploratory data analysis on the relationship between the different attributes of an
									AirBnB and the property's daily rental price for the New York area for a group project for the UCSD COGS 108, Data Science in Practice course. Some of the attributes that we conducted our analysis with are number of bedrooms, borough,
								number of amenities, and many more. </p>
								<p> &#x2022; We utlized the Pandas library to clean our dataset in order for it to contain only the necessary variables we were interested in investigating. We also explored the various relationships between
									attributes with data visualization tools such as Seaborn, and Matplotlib. We also performed statistical tests such as a t-test, and linear regression model
								using the Python SciPy library. </p>
								<p>  &#x2022; We found that the biggest attributes that contributes to the price of an AirBnB listing
									is the location of the property but we also found other smaller factors that contributed to the price.

								<h3>Investigating the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Model using the Fine-Tuning Strategies and Contrastive Learning (December 2022)</h3>
								<p style="color: burlywood;"> Skills: Python, NumPy, PyTorch, NLP, Hugging Face, OS, tqdm, Matplotlib  </p>
								<p> &#x2022; In this Natural Language Processing (NLP) group project for the UCSD CSE 151B, Deep Learning course, we investigated the Google developed BERT model by performing transfer learning by training the
									BERT model on the Amazon Massive Intent dataset in order to classify user intents.
								</p>
								<p> &#x2022; In this project we trained our encoder-decoder architecture with fine tuning strategies such as the Warm-up steps strategy and the Layer-wise Learning Rate
									Decay (LLRD). We also trained our model with our baseline cross-entropy loss, SupConstrast, and SimCLR losses. </p>

								<p> &#x2022; Our test set results for our baseline model after applying the Fine-Tuning strategies aforementioned above were at an 88% accuracy. Overall, we heavily utlized the PyTorch and HuggingFace
									frameworks, a GPU cluster, along with many more Python frameworks listed above in order to complete our project.</p>

								<h3>Implementing a CNN to an LSTM model for Image Captioning of the COCO Dataset and ResNet50 to LSTM Model (November 2022- December 2022)</h3>
								<p style="color: burlywood;"> Skills: Python, NumPy, PyTorch, NLP, OS, tqdm, Matplotlib  </p>
								<p> &#x2022; In this group project for the UCSD CSE 151B, Deep Learning course, we performed image captioning by using a Convolutional Neural
									Network (CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network to generate text as captions for images. We also perform transfer learning by using
									ResNet50 and again apply our LSTM to perform image captioning.
								</p>

								<p> &#x2022; Our motivation for using a CNN-LSTM architecture for image captionig of the COCO dataset was that in everyday images there are many things occuring in an image
									and we can't simply classify an image as Cat, Dog, etc. Therefore, we used this architecture to generate captions in order to account for the highly dimensional images and their RGB channels. </p>

								<p> &#x2022; We evaluated our generated image captions using BLEU scores. Our best model was the ResNet50 model without any 
									hyperparameter changes as we achieved a BLEU1 score of 54.47. Overall, we utilized PyTorch modules to succesfully generate images cations using the COCO dataset and found that the transfer learning
								with a ResNet50 gave us more realistic and accurate captions than a standard CNN.  </p>

								<h3>Implementing a Multi-Layer Neural Network from scratch for Multi-Class Classification of the CIFAR-10 Dataset (October 2022)</h3>
								<p style="color: burlywood;"> Skills: Python, NumPy, OS, tqdm, Matplotlib  </p>
								<p> &#x2022; In this group project for the UCSD CSE 151B, Deep Learning course, we constructed a Multi-Layer Neural Network from scratch using the NumPy
									library in order to perform Multi-Class classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We implemented both forward and backward propagation from scratch, tested our Neural Network with different activation functions
								such as sigmoid and ReLU and recorded performance on the test and training set for each activation function. </p>
								<p> &#x2022; We also conducted experiments on the Neural Network Topology such as increasing the number of hidden units in each layer and increasing the number
									of hidden layers. We implemented various popular and widely used techniques in Deep Learning such as K-fold Cross Validation in order to test how our model
									would perform on unseen data/test data. We also implemented various optimization techniques from scratch with NumPy such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and SGD with momentum.
